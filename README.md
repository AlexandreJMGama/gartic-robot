### Running the app

Before you start using it, keep in mind that the intention of this app is not to cheat, but rather a study experiment.

The app is very intuitive and easy to use, but to make a resume of how it works, you can read these follow steps.

- Run the app using node with `node app.js`;
- Go to gartic.io and enter in a room (you can also create one);
- When it's your turn, choose a drawing;
- Search for a image and tell the robot the url.
